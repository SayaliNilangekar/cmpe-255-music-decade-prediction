- 255_Project_Regression.ipynb: This file contains the code for running the regression analysis on the dataset

- 255_Project_Classification.ipynb: This file contains the code for training and running classification models on the dataset

The dataset* necessary to run these files can be found at the following website: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/yearpredictionmsd 

*NOTE: Due to the large file size of the dataset, we are unable to upload the dataset directly to GitHub. Therefore, please download the dataset from the aforementioned website.

# Project Description

Our project presents a regression and classification analysis of a subset of the Million Songs Dataset. We have attempted to use various regression models to successfully predict the release year of a song and also tried to use various classification models to categorize songs by decade based on various features given in the dataset linked above.
